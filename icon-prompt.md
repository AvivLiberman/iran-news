# Icon Generation Prompt

Use the following prompt with an image generation AI (DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, etc.) to create an icon for the Iran News Monitor site.

## Prompt

A minimalist app icon for a news monitoring website focused on Iran. Design: a stylized eye or radar/signal wave overlaid on or blended with a subtle silhouette of Iran's geographic outline. Use a dark navy or charcoal background with accents in deep red and amber/gold — evoking both urgency and a Middle Eastern palette. The icon should feel like a modern intelligence/news dashboard badge: clean geometric shapes, no text, strong contrast, readable at 32×32 pixels. Style: flat design with slight depth through shadow or gradient. Avoid clichés like flags or explosions.

## Usage

Once generated, save the result as `favicon.ico` (or `favicon.png`) in the project root and add the appropriate `<link>` tag to `index.html`:

```html
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="favicon.png">
```
